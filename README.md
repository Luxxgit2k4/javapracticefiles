# Javapracticefiles

## Description

This repository contains various Java practice programs that I have worked on while learning and improving my Java programming skills using IntelliJ IDEA. Each program covers different Java concepts which can be helpful while referring.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **IntelliJ IDEA**: An integrated development environment for Java. I highly recommend this one because its the best code editor for Java. You can download it from [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/).
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Make sure you have JDK installed on your machine. You can download it from the [official Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) or [AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/).

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
```
  git clone https://github.com/Luxxgit2k4/javapracticefiles.git
```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

```
   cd javapracticefiles
```
3. **Open the Project in IntelliJ IDEA**

Open IntelliJ IDEA and choose "Open Project" from the main menu. Navigate to the directory you just cloned and open it.

### Usage

1. **Import the Project**
    
    IntelliJ IDEA should automatically detect the `pom.xml` or `build.gradle` file if you are using Maven or Gradle. If not, you can manually set up the project by configuring the SDK and adding any necessary libraries.
    
2. **Run the Main Class**
    
    - Locate the `Main.java` file or equivalent main class in the `src` folder of the specific project.
    - Right-click on the `Main` class and select "Run 'Main.main()'" to execute the application.
3. **Explore and Modify**
    
    - Explore the source code and make changes to practice or extend the functionality.
    - Feel free to modify the code or add new features to enhance your learning experience.
